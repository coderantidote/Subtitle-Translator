# Subtitle Translator

A tool to translate subtitle files.

## Getting Started

First of all this tool uses Google translate. Soon , I'll be adding Yandex and Microsoft Translate soon.

### Requirement
```
Php 5.x and 7.x
```
### Installing

Since there is no database in the project, you just need to throw the files to your server.

### Security

Necessary security measures have been taken at the data entry exits. Security measures are high in the XSS and File upload section.

#### Install using git
```
git clone https://github.com/coderantidote/Subtitle-Translator.git
```
